```

Previous scale (removed):
```
5, 7, 28, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 72, 80, 96
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Projects

✅ **No changes needed** - All common spacing values are still available
✅ All responsive variants work as before
✅ Grid, flexbox, and centering remain unchanged

### If Using Large Spacing Values

If your code uses removed values (28-96rem), you can:

1. **Use an alternate value** - 32 is the largest available now
2. **Add custom CSS** - Use your own classes for extra-large spacing
3. **Use CSS variables** - Define custom properties for special cases

Example workaround:
```css
/* In your custom CSS */
.custom-spacing-40 {
  margin: 10rem; /* 40 * 0.25rem */
}
```

## What's Same

✅ 12-column grid system
✅ Flexbox utilities
✅ Centering components
✅ Responsive breakpoints (6 total)
✅ All documented APIs
✅ npm publishing support
✅ GitHub integration
✅ Development tools
